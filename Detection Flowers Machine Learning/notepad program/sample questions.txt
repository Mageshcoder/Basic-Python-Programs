Confused Pappu
Pappu is confused between 6 & 9. He works in the billing department of ABC company and his work is to return the remaining amount to customers. If the actual remaining amount is given, we need to find the maximum possible extra amount given by Pappu to the customers.

For example:-

If the actual remaining amount = 56. Then maximum possible extra amount = (59 - 56 ) = 3.



Format:

Input:

The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.
The first line of each test case contains N (actual remaining amount).

Output:

For each test case, the output for the maximum possible extra amount should be in the new line.



Constraints:

1 ≤ T ≤ 102

1 ≤ N ≤ 10000001

 

Example:

Input:

3

6

66
